        <p id="firstp">Drawing is my favourite hobby.Whenever I get a free time I draw the pictures of trees,birds,animals.I also got a first price in school in drawing competition.With the help of drawing I share my experience.I like drawing since I was 6 years old. I like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. Drawing is the perfect way to make things look alive. I imagine all kinds of strange things to show it on a piece of paper such as hell & demons, a beautiful house in heaven etc.

            I have decorated my house with lot of my drawings. Every year I gift my grandparents and parents with my drawing on their birthday because they are very fond of my drawings and always encourage me to practice more. Drawing has now become the most important part of my life. But most of the times I am unable to take out much time due to my studies and social life. But still I manage to take out sometime and practice to improve my drawing.
